<!-- The sections below are the minimum an agent needs to build this safely.
     If a section does not apply, write "none" rather than deleting it, so a
     reader knows it was considered. -->

## Goal

What outcome, in one or two sentences.

## Definition of done

The observable that proves it is done, and its negative.

- Observable: ...
- Negative: what must still FAIL when the work is done (the test or check that
  would go green if the work regressed).

## Scope

What changes, by file or area.

- ...

## Out of scope

What this story deliberately does not do, so the work does not creep.

- ...

## Consumers and surfaces touched

Every contract this touches, and what must stay true for its consumer: the
report format (`socair.report/v1`) and its row names, signed attestations and
acceptances, the airlock store and its log, the feed format, CLI commands and
their output, and the API. Write "none" for a pure docs change.

- ...

## Verdicts

Whether this can change what any check reports. If it can: the
`docs/check-set.md` row and `CheckSetVersion` bump, the benchmark cases it
moves, and the real-corpus gate it is measured on. Write "none" if no verdict
can change.

- ...

## Verification

The exact commands that must pass, and the expected result.

```sh
# ...
```

## Falsification

The production edit that must make a test or check fail, and the failure you
expect to see. If you cannot name one, the verification does not bite.

- Edit: ...
- Expected failure: ...

## Risks

What could go wrong, and the unknowns worth calling out before building.
